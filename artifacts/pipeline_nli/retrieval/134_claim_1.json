The war with Spain being ended, Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government, without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. 0345m Some time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he returned to France, when",

The principal charge against you is this letter, and you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited until it was entirely consumed. “You see, I destroy it?” “Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness itself.” “Listen,” continued Villefort; “you can now have confidence in me after what I have done.” “Oh, command, and I will obey.” “Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.” “Speak, and I will follow your advice.” “I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but do not breathe a word of this letter.” “I promise.” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner who reassured him. “You see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is destroyed; you and I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be",

The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read with English coolness, and having finished: “I understand,” said he, “perfectly.” 30293m Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of the count’s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices; then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government",

Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string. “Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois. “Yes.” “Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?” “No.” “To Mademoiselle Valentine?” “No.” “To M. Franz d’Épinay?” “Yes.” Franz, astonished, advanced a step. “To me, sir?” said he. “Yes.” Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read: “‘To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath the packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document.’ “Well, sir,” asked Franz, “what do you wish me to do with this paper?” “To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,” said the procureur. “No,” replied Noirtier eagerly. “Do you wish him to read it?” said Valentine. “Yes,” replied the old man. “You understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,” said Valentine. “Then let us sit down,” said Villefort impatiently, “for it will take some time.” “Sit",

    "text": "assumed the garb of reality. Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a visit. M. Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the baroness, and he accepted the invitation. It was never without a nervous shudder, since the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which followed it, that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristo’s name announced. If he did not come, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability, his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon dispelled every impression of fear. It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end—useless injury is repugnant to every mind. 40048m When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir, to which we have already once introduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some drawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M. Cavalcanti, his presence soon produced",
