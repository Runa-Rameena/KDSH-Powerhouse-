      "text": " peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian\nschemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities,\nand he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible\ntheories of The Mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means\nthat were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.”\n\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “it is just as I thought; it was politics\nwhich brought Noirtier and M. d’Épinay into personal contact. Although\nGeneral d’Épinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain\nroyalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one\nevening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited\non the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?”\n\nVillefort looked at the count almost with terror.\n\n“Am I mistaken, then?” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said Madame\nde Villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M.\nde Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the\ntwo children of these inveterate enemies.”\n\n“It was a sublime and charitable thought,” said Monte Cristo, “and the\nwhole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle\nNoirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d’Épinay.”\n\nVillefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read\nin his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he\nhad just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and\nprevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile\nhe was so constantly in the habit of assuming.\n\n“Although,” said Villefort, “it will be a serious thing for Valentine\nto lose her grandfather’s fortune, I do not think that M. d’Épinay will\nbe frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in\ngreater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice\neverything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that\nValentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all\nprobability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran, her\nmother’s parents, who both love her tenderly.”\n\n“And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,”\nsaid Madame de Villefort; “besides, they are to come to Paris in about\na month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not\nconsider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut\nup with M. Noirtier.”\n\nThe count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love\nand defeated ambition.\n\n“But it seems to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and I must begin by asking\nyour pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits\nMademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose\nfather he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against\nthis dear Edward.”\n\n“True,” said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it\nis impossible to describe; “is it not unjust—shamefully unjust? Poor\nEdward is as much M. Noirtier’s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if\nshe had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left\nher all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her\ngrandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.”\n\nThe count listened and said no more.\n\n“Count,” said Villefort, “we will not entertain you any longer with our\nfamily misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow\ncharitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my\nlawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have\nthe satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and\nfeeling. M. d’Épinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum,\nshall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.”\n\n“However,” said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which\nincessantly occupied her mind, “perhaps it would be better to explain\nthis unlucky affair to M. d’Épinay, in order to give him the\nopportunity of himself renouncing his c"

For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures, I\nshow you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young\nagain—a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your\nmarriage with Mercédès, my betrothed!”\n\n40268m\n\n\n\nThe general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed,\nlooked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to\nsupport him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door,\nthrough which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful,\nlamentable, distressing cry:\n\n“Edmond Dantès!”\n\nThen, with sighs which were unlike any human sound, he dragged himself\nto the door, reeled across the courtyard, and falling into the arms of\nhis valet, he said in a voice scarcely intelligible,—“Home, home.”\n\nThe fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before\nhis servants, partly recalled his senses, but the ride was short, and\nas he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived. He stopped at a\nshort distance from the house and alighted. The door was wide open, a\nhackney-coach was standing in the middle of the yard—a strange sight\nbefore so noble a mansion; the count looked at it with terror, but\nwithout daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed towards his apartment.\n\nTwo persons were coming down the stairs; he had only time to creep into\nan alcove to avoid them. It was Mercédès leaning on her son’s arm and\nleaving the house. They passed close by the unhappy being, who,\nconcealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercédès dress brush\npast him, and his son’s warm breath, pronouncing these words:\n\n“Courage, mother! Come, this is no longer our home!”\n\nThe words died away, the steps were lost in the distance. The general\ndrew himself up, clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful\nsob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same\ntime by his wife and son. He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of\nthe hackney-coach, then the coachman’s voice, and then the rolling of\nthe heavy vehicle shook the windows. He darted to his bedroom to see\nonce more all he had loved in the world; but the hackney-coach drove on\nand the head of neither Mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to\ntake a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband.\n\nAnd at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the\ngateway a report was heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of\nthe panes of the window, which was broken by the explosion.\n\n40270m\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 93. Valentine\n\nWe may easily conceive where Morrel’s appointment was. On leaving Monte\nCristo he walked slowly towards Villefort’s; we say slowly, for Morrel\nhad more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he\nhad hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be\nalone with his thoughts. He knew his time well—the hour when Valentine\nwas giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in\nthe performance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given\nhim leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that\npermission.\n\nHe arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and almost crazed, she\nseized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This uneasiness,\namounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf’s adventure\nhad made in the world, for the affair at the Opera was generally known.\nNo one at Villefort’s doubted that a duel would ensue from it.\nValentine, with her woman’s instinct, guessed that Morrel would be\nMonte Cristo’s second, and from the young man’s well-known courage and\nhis great affection for the count, she feared that he would not content\nhimself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily understand\nhow eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and received; and\nMorrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when\nshe knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was\nunexpected.\n\n“Now,” said Valentine, motioni"

There are\nyet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think\nthat I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I\nsometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the\nsame sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better\nthan suffering.”\n\n“But, sir, he has fled; let him escape—inaction is a pardonable\noffence.”\n\n“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was\nemployed, and at this very minute——”\n\n“Sir,” said the valet de chambre, entering the room, “a dragoon has\nbrought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior.”\n\nVillefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame\nDanglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.\n\n“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”\n\nMadame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.\n\n“Adieu, sir,” she said.\n\n“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful\nmanner he conducted her to the door. Then, turning to his desk, he\nsaid, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:\n\n“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only\nwanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!”\n\n\n\n Chapter 100. The Apparition\n\nAs the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet\nrecovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;\nand it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,\nthat she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the\nflight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather\nBenedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against\nhim. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\n\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward.\n\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had\nelapsed, and Valentine still lived.\n\nThe nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her\nsleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking\nhours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from\nthe alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass\nand repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with\ntheir trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother\nthreatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes\nmere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even\nthe very furniture, in thes"

      "text": "n; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return\nto Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding\nthe uneasiness she experienced. On his wife’s request, M. de Villefort\nwas the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his\nlandau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his\nwife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with\nM. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While\nMonte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he\nhad noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon\nguessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been\nuttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.\nWithout opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Château-Renaud,\nand Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort’s\ncarriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had\noffered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury\nwaiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the\nEnglish fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray\nhorse.\n\nAndrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,\nand he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,\namongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king’s attorney. Then he\nhad been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the\nstiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into\nconsideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he\nwas in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly\neducation of his heir. He contemplated with unspeakable delight the\nlarge diamond which shone on the major’s little finger; for the major,\nlike a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his\nbank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.\nThen, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the\nfather and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son,\npreviously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive\nhis 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of\naffability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s\nservants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself\nupon.\n\nOne thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the\nveneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the\nprinciple of Horace, _nil admirari_, had contented himself with showing\nhis knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.\nThen he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore,\nconcluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the\nillustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed\nupon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by\nthe same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake\nFusaro, and the sterlet from the Volga. Thus it was with much\npoliteness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words:\n\n“Tomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on\nbusiness.”\n\n“And I, sir,” said Danglars, “shall be most happy to receive you.”\n\nUpon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel\ndes Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his\nson. To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his\nson had lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and\ncarriages, and that not having come together, it would not be difficult\nfor them to leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by\nthe side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of\norder and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to\nallow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a\nfortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.\n\nAs for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom,\nwho, instead of bringing the tilbury t"
