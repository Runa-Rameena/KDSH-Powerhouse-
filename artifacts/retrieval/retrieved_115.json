      "text": "and it was time. The two ladies exerted themselves\nheroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged\nthemselves along, they no longer walked.\n\nThe next day they started at daybreak, and at eleven o'clock Delegete\ncame in sight, fifty miles from Twofold Bay. Here means of conveyance\nwere quickly obtained. Feeling himself so near the coast, hope returned\nto Glenarvan's heart; perhaps there had been some slight delay, and he\nwould arrive before the Duncan! In twenty-four hours he would reach the\nbay!\n\nAt noon, after a comforting repast, all the travelers took their seats\nin a mail-coach, and left Delegete at the full speed of five strong\nhorses. The postilions, stimulated by the promise of a large reward,\ndrove them along at a rapid rate, over a well-kept road. No time was\nlost in changing horses, and it seemed as if Glenarvan had inspired\nall with his own intense eagerness.\n\n[Illustration: The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their\nstrength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no\nlonger walked.]\n\nAll day and all night they traveled with the same swiftness, and at\nsunrise the next morning a low murmur announced the proximity of the\nIndian Ocean. It was necessary, however, to pass around the bay to gain\nthat part of the coast where Tom Austin was to meet the travelers.\n\nWhen the sea appeared, all eyes quickly surveyed the wide expanse. Was\nthe Duncan there, by a miracle of Providence, as she had been discerned\nbefore by some of them on the Argentine coast? Nothing was seen; sky\nand water mingled in an unbroken horizon; not a sail brightened the\nvast extent of ocean.\n\nOne hope still remained. Perhaps Tom Austin had thought it best to cast\nanchor in Twofold Bay, as the sea was rough and a vessel could not be\nmoored in safety near such shores.\n\n\"To Eden!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe mail-coach at once took the road to the right, which ran along the\nedge of the bay, and proceeded towards the little town of Eden, only\nfive miles distant. The postilions stopped not far from the light that\nguarded the entrance to the harbor. Several ships were anchored in the\nroadstead, but none displayed the flag of Malcolm Castle.\n\nGlenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Paganel alighted immediately, and\nhastened to the custom-house. Here they questioned the employees, and\nconsulted the latest arrivals. No vessel had entered the bay for a week.\n\n\"She may not have started!\" cried Glenarvan, who would not despair.\n\"Perhaps we have arrived before her!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles shook his head. He knew Tom Austin; his mate would\nnever have delayed so long to execute an order.\n\n\"I will know what this means,\" said Glenarvan. \"Certainty is better\nthan doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOPE.]\n\nFifteen minutes later a telegram was sent to the ship-brokers of\nMelbourne, and the travelers repaired to the Victoria Hotel. Not long\nafter an answer was delivered to Lord Glenarvan. It read as follows:\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\n            Eden, Twofold Bay.\n\n\"Duncan started on the 18th instant for some unknown destination.\"\n\nThe dispatch fell from Glenarvan's hands. There was no more doubt! The\nhonest Scotch yacht, in Ben Joyce's hands, had become a pirate-vessel!\n\nThus ended their search in Australia, begun under such favorable\nauspices. The traces of Captain Grant and his shipwrecked sailors\nseemed irrecoverably lost. This failure had cost the lives of an entire\ncrew. Lord Glenarvan was crushed by the blow, and this courageous\nsearcher, whom the leagued elements had failed to deter, was now\nbaffled by the malice of men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nA ROUGH CAPTAIN.\n\n\nIf ever the searchers for Captain Grant had reason to despair of seeing\nhim again, was it not when every hope forsook them at once? To what\npart of the world should they venture a new expedition? how explore\nunknown countries? The Duncan was no longer in their possession, and\nthey could not be immediately reconciled to their misfortune. The\nundertaking of these generous Scots had, therefore, fail"

A young man\ndoes not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”\n\n“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”\n\n“Any way, mother.”\n\n“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”\n\n“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100\nfrancs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the\nornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of\nsuperfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs\nwe require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”\n\n“But we owe something in this house?”\n\n“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is\nunderstood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see\nI am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to\nthis, mother?”\n\nAnd Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a\nremnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of\nthe mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little\ndoor,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.\n\n“What is this?” asked Mercédès.\n\n“A thousand francs.”\n\n“But whence have you obtained them?”\n\n“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And\nAlbert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at\nher. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the\nyoung man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,\nindeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”\n\n“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear\nwhich glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted\nmisfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy\nwhile I possess my son!”\n\n“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the\ndecision we have come to, mother?”\n\n“Have we come to any?”\n\n“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am\nto leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the\nname I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès\nsighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the\nSpahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain\nfeeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his\nself-a"

      "text": "e startling than to observe the\nexpression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the\nrest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the\npower of participation. Three persons only could understand this\nlanguage of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and\nthe old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined. It is one of the most desirable connections which could\npossibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and\nevery personal qualification likely "

You know the affairs of the deceased are\nin perfect order, and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire\nproperty of the Saint-Méran family; the notary showed me the documents\nyesterday, which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately.\nYou may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau, Faubourg\nSaint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect those deeds.”\n\n“Sir,” replied M. d’Épinay, “it is not, perhaps, the moment for\nMademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think of a husband;\nindeed, I fear——”\n\n40028m\n\n\n\n“Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her\ngrandmother’s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that\nquarter, I assure you.”\n\n“In that case,” replied Franz, “as I shall raise none, you may make\narrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel\npleasure and happiness in adhering to it.”\n\n“Then,” said Villefort, “nothing further is required. The contract was\nto have been signed three days since; we shall find it all ready, and\ncan sign it today.”\n\n“But the mourning?” said Franz, hesitating.\n\n“Don’t be uneasy on that score,” replied Villefort; “no ceremony will\nbe neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during\nthe prescribed three months to her estate of Saint-Méran; I say hers,\nfor she inherits it today. There, after a few days, if you like, the\ncivil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony. Madame de\nSaint-Méran wished her daughter should be married there. When that is\nover, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife passes the time of\nher mourning with her mother-in-law.”\n\n“As you please, sir,” said Franz.\n\n“Then,” replied M. de Villefort, “have the kindness to wait half an\nhour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will send for\nM. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate,\nand this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her\nestate, where we will rejoin them in a week.”\n\n“Sir,” said Franz, “I have one request to make.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud to be present at\nthis signature; you know they are my witnesses.”\n\n“Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them\nyourself, or shall you send?”\n\n“I prefer going, sir.”\n\n“I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will\nbe ready.”\n\nFranz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de\nVillefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in\nhalf an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d’Épinay and his\nwitnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the house;\nMadame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was\nthunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone down to\nher grandfather’s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who\ntook her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom,\nValentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A\nmoment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her\nlittle Edward. It was evident that she had shared the grief of the\nfamily, for she was pale and looked fatigued. She sat down, took Edward\non her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her\naffections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom.\n\nTwo carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard. One was the\nnotary’s; the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the\nwhole party was assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the\nblue veins from her temples, round her "
