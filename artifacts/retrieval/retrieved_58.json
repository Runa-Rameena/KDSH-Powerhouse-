But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars’ heart\nfailed him, and he lived in constant fear of Dantès’ return on a\nmission of vengeance. He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to\nquit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish\nmerchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March, that is,\nten or twelve days after Napoleon’s return. He then left for Madrid,\nand was no more heard of.\n\nFernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent. What had\nbecome of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the\nabsence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of\ndeceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of\nemigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and\nmotionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence\nMarseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of\na young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of\nvengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot Dantès, and then\nkill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never\nkills himself, for he constantly hopes.\n\nDuring this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man\nin France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the\nemperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible\nthought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and\nmarry Mercédès. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have\ndone so when he parted from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion\nhe showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce\non noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand,\nand this was now strengthened by gratitude.\n\n“My brother,” said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,\n“be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the\nworld.” These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand’s heart. Should\nDantès not return, Mercédès might one day be his.\n\n0165m\n\n\n\nMercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never\nseemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in\ntears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute\nand motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times\ngazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to\ncast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was\nnot want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into\nexecution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\n\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married\nand eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès,\nwho was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon’s downfall.\nFive months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the\nhour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M. Morrel\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old\nman had contracted.\n\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of\nso dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.\n\n\n\n Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners\n\nA year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the\ninspector-general of prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the nois"

      "text": "Edward!\" cried Lady Glenarvan.\n\nIt was difficult to proceed in any other way, and, at all hazards,\nGlenarvan determined to break the neck of the precious bottle. It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced. For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes.\n\n\"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n\"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\"\n\nIt showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\"\n\n\"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\"\n\n\"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\"\n\n\"By comparing one document with another.\"\n\n\"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\nThe second piece of paper, more damaged than the former, exhibited only\nisolated words, arranged thus:\n\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is written in German,\" said Captain Mangles, when he had cast his\neyes upon it.\n\n\"And do you know that language?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Perfectly, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us what these few words mean.\"\n\nThe captain examined the document closely, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"First, the date of the event is determined. _7 Juni_ means June 7th,\nand by comparing this figure with the figures '62,' furnished by the\nEnglish document, we have the date complete,--June 7th, 1862.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" exclaimed Lady Helena. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"On the same line,\" continued the young captain, \"I find the word\n_Glas_, which, united with the word _gow_ of the first document, gives\n_Glasgow_. It is plainly a ship from the port of Glasgow.\"\n\n\"That was my opinion,\" said the major.\n\n\"The second line is missing entirely,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"but\non the third I meet with two important words _zwei_, which means _two_,\nand _atrosen_, or rather _matrosen_, which signifies _sailors_ in\nGerman.\"\n\n\"There were a captain and two sailors, then?\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"I will confess, your lordship,\" said the ca"

      "text": "antès\nnoticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had, as he neared the\nland, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise,\ncan throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.\n\nBut on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything\nproceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came\noff with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in\nacknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the\nsea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the\nmorning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune Amélie_ and on _terra\nfirma_. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of _La\nJeune Amélie_, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred\nTuscan livres, or about eighty francs.\n\nBut the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards\nSardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace\nwhat had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the\nfirst, _La Jeune Amélie_ was in luck. This new cargo was destined for\nthe coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of\nHavana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.\n\nThere they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the\nexcise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune\nAmélie_. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded;\nDantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left\nshoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at\nbeing wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what\neye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear\nsuffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded\nhad exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.”\n\nHe had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death,\nand, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill\nof human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.\nDantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the\nend he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in\nhis bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and\nrushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all\nthe kindness of a devoted comrade.\n\nThis world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither\nwas it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing\nto expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the\nprize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.\nFortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain\nherbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old\nSardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try\nJacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his\nprize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.\n\nAs a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first\nbestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of\naffection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that\nEdmond had a right to superiority of position—a superiority which\nEdmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness\nwhich Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.\n\nThen in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with\nsecurity over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the\nhelmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,\nwith a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor\nAbbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of\nthe coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught\nhim to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call\nheaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\n\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these\nthings to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows? You ma"
