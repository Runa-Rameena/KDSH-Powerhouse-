      "text": "towing such a\npeace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\nruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\nshattered frame.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look\nexpressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound\ncontempt. Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\ntake leave.\n\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\neyes.\n\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her.\n\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\nand you are angry?”\n\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.\n\n“Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Madame de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated.\n\n“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\nNoirtier again closed his eyes.\n\n“And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\nme?” cried Valentine.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued:\n\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\nme?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.\n\n“Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\n\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\n\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\n\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\n\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\ntogether?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\nold man assented.\n\n“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\nno.”\n\n“Then you are vexed with the engageme"

      "text": "e startling than to observe the\nexpression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the\nrest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the\npower of participation. Three persons only could understand this\nlanguage of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and\nthe old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined. It is one of the most desirable connections which could\npossibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and\nevery personal qualification likely "

      "text": "e de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of\na bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its\nhead.\n\nA hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from\nher, while she became deadly pale.\n\n“Monsieur,” she said, “I—I do not understand you.”\n\nAnd, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the\nsofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down\nagain on the cushions.\n\n“I asked you,” continued Villefort, in a perfectly calm tone, “where\nyou conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my\nfather-in-law, M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Madame de\nSaint-Méran, Barrois, and my daughter Valentine.”\n\n“Ah, sir,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, “what do\nyou say?”\n\n“It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.”\n\n“Is it to the judge or to the husband?” stammered Madame de Villefort.\n\n“To the judge—to the judge, madame!” It was terrible to behold the\nfrightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling\nof her whole frame.\n\n“Ah, sir,” she muttered, “ah, sir,” and this was all.\n\n“You do not answer, madame!” exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then\nhe added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, “It is true,\nthen; you do not deny it!” She moved forward. “And you cannot deny it!”\nadded Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her\nin the name of justice. “You have accomplished these different crimes\nwith impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose\naffections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de\nSaint-Méran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.\nd’Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions\nwere directed towards an angel,—those suspicions which, even when there\nis no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of\nValentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in\nmine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,\nsuspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just\nnow, you no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge.”\n\n50165m\n\n\n\nThe young woman hid her face in her hands.\n\n“Oh, sir,” she stammered, “I beseech you, do not believe appearances.”\n\n“Are you, then, a coward?” cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.\n“But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a\ncoward, you, who have had the courage to witness the death of two old\nmen and a young girl murdered by you?”\n\n“Sir! sir!”\n\n“Can you be a coward?” continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,\n“you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?\n_You_, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages\nwith a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have\ncalculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate\none thing—I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?\nOh, it is impossible—you must have saved some surer, more subtle and\ndeadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment that\nyou deserve. You have done this—I hope so, at least.”\n\nMadame de Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.\n\n“I understand,” he said, “you confess; but a confession made to the\njudges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime\ncannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the\nguilty!”\n\n“The punishment?” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, “the punishment,\nmonsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!”\n\n“Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times\nguilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are\nthe wife of him who pronounces it?—No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits\nthe poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner\nhas taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her\ndeadliest poison.”\n\nMadame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous and\nuncontrollable ter"

You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the\npaper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter\nfrom his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud\npassed over his brow as he said:\n\n“No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably\nplain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he,\nlooking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you;\nfor this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that\nthe young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid\nbeneath this mildness.\n\n“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a\njudge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what\ntruth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?”\nAnd Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just\ngiven back to him.\n\n“None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a\nsailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”\n\n“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée could\nsee me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a\ndecapitator.”\n\n“Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a\nbrain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to\narrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder\nrose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was\ndying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to\nperform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest\nimportance.’\n\n“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.\n\n“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume\nthe command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at\nPorto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps\nthey will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission.\nYou will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor\nand profit from it.’\n\n“‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the\ngrand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’\n\n“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every\ndifficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was\ntime—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”\n\n“And what did you do then?”\n\n“What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my\nplace. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with\na sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for\nthe Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody\nto remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found\nsome difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent\nthe ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly\nadmitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as\nthe latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in\nParis. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I\nlanded here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit\nmy affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.\nMorrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at\nmy marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and\ntomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this\ncharge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”\n\n“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth. If you have been\nculpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to\nthe orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from\nElba, and pass your word you will appear should you be re"
