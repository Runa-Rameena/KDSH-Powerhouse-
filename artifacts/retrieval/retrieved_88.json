I might have handed him\nover to Roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would\nhave been particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort—I\nsuffered him and his band to depart.”\n\n“With the condition that they should sin no more,” said Beauchamp,\nlaughing. “I see they kept their promise.”\n\n“No, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo “upon the simple condition that\nthey should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to\nsay may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and\nyour duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which\ndoes not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies\nitself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place\nin my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society\nand my neighbor who are indebted to me.”\n\n“Bravo,” cried Château-Renaud; “you are the first man I ever met\nsufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!”\n\n“It is frank, at least,” said Morrel. “But I am sure that the count\ndoes not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so\nboldly avowed.”\n\n“How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?” asked Monte\nCristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,\nthat two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that\nclear and piercing glance.\n\n“Why, it seems to me,” replied Morrel, “that in delivering M. de\nMorcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to\nsociety.”\n\n“Of which he is the brightest ornament,” said Beauchamp, drinking off a\nglass of champagne.\n\n“My dear count,” cried Morcerf, “you are at fault—you, one of the most\nformidable logicians I know—and you must see it clearly proved that\ninstead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call\nyourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family\nname is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,\nand yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display\nthe greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric\nParisians,—that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the\nvirtues you possess.”\n\n“My dear vicomte,” returned Monte Cristo, “I do not see, in all I have\ndone, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the\npretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for I\nknew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to\nbreakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival\nin your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del\nPopolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.\nI will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the\nhands of a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had\nthe idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when\nI came to France. You might some time ago have looked upon this\nresolution as a vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and\nyou must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word.”\n\n“I will keep it,” returned Morcerf; “but I fear that you will be much\ndisappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic\nhorizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with\nwhich your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our\nChimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great\nDesert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian\nwell to water the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so\nmany as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a\npoliceman than a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a\ncity, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments—I say\neighty-five, be"

The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort\nfelt no effects.\n\nThe breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The\nvalet re-entered.\n\n“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven\no’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”\n\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”\n\n“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know\nif she is to accompany you, sir?”\n\n“Where to?”\n\n“To the Palais.”\n\n“What to do?”\n\n“My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.”\n\n“Ah,” said Villefort, with a startling accent; “does she wish that?”\n\nThe servant drew back and said, “If you wish to go alone, sir, I will\ngo and tell my mistress.”\n\nVillefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with\nhis nails.\n\n“Tell your mistress,” he at length answered, “that I wish to speak to\nher, and I beg she will wait for me in her own room.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then come to dress and shave me.”\n\n“Directly, sir.”\n\nThe valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having shaved his master,\nassisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had finished, he said:\n\n“My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had\nfinished dressing.”\n\n“I am going to her.”\n\nAnd Villefort, with his papers under his arm and hat in hand, directed\nhis steps toward the apartment of his wife.\n\nAt the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then\nentered the room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and\nimpatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets\nwhich young Edward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces\nbefore his mother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out,\nher bonnet was placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her\nhands.\n\n“Ah, here you are, monsieur,” she said in her naturally calm voice;\n“but how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not\ncome down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take\nEdward?”\n\nMadame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one\nanswer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold\nas a statue.\n\n“Edward,” said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, “go\nand play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.”\n\nMadame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance,\nthat resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries. Edward\nraised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did\nnot confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden\nsoldiers.\n\n“Edward,” cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up\nfrom the floor, “do you hear me?—Go!”\n\nThe child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling;\nit would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or\npassion. His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed\nhis forehead.\n\n“Go,” he said: “go, my child.” Edward ran out.\n\nM. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and\nbolted.\n\n“Dear me!” said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband’s\ninmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze\nthe impassibility of Villefort; “what is the matter?”\n\n“Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?” said the\nmagistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife\nand the door.\n\nMadame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of\na bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its\nhead.\n\nA hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from\nher, while she became deadly pale.\n\n“Monsieur,” she said, “I—I do not understand you.”\n\nAnd, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the\nsofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down\nagain on the cushions.\n\n“I asked you,” continued Villefort,"

      "text": "r sails, Edmond,\nwith a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor\nAbbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of\nthe coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught\nhim to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call\nheaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\n\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these\nthings to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows? You may\none day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte,\nbecame emperor.” We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.\n\nTwo months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as\nskilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an\nacquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the\nMasonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had\npassed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not\nonce had he found an opportunity of landing there.\n\nHe then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron\nof _La Jeune Amélie_ ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own\naccount—for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred\npiastres—and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo.\nThen he would be free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at\nliberty, for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied\nhim. But in this world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond\nprudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain\ndid he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any\nplan for reaching the island without companionship.\n\nDantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron,\nwho had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him\nin his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern\non the Via del’ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to\ncongregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already\nDantès had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing\nall these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly\ntwo hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might\nnot that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all\nthese contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter\nthat was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey\ncarpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find\nsome neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try\nand land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was\nsuccessful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty\nor sixty piastres each for the crew.\n\nThe patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ proposed as a place of landing the\nIsland of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having\nneither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in\nthe midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by\nMercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we\nin modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which\nantiquity appears to have included in the same category.\n\nAt the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy; he rose to\nconceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all\nthe languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_.\n\nWhen he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the\nmatter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and\nset out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion\nthat the island afforded every possible security, and that great\nenterprises to be well done should be done quickly.\n\nNothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get\nunder weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the\nneutral island by the following day.\n\n0289m\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 23.
