The days when such\ndistinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in\nFrance, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with\nthose of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself\nwith the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class;\nand certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging\nas well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered,\nand the memory of my late father is respected in our country,\nValentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the\ncity; I say our country, because you were born not far from\nMarseilles.”\n\n“Don’t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word\nbrings back my mother to my recollection—my angel mother, who died too\nsoon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her\nchild during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I\nfondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were\nstill living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would\ntell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.”\n\n“I fear, Valentine,” replied the lover, “that were she living I should\nnever have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been\ntoo happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on\nme.”\n\n“Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,” cried Valentine; “but there\nis one thing I wish to know.”\n\n“And what is that?” inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine\nhesitated.\n\n“Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers\ndwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?”\n\n“Not that I am aware of,” replied the young man, “unless, indeed, any\nill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties—your\nfather was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine\nwas wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any\nother difference between them. But why do you ask?”\n\n“I will tell you,” replied the young girl, “for it is but right you\nshould know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of\nthe Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting\nwith my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also—you\nrecollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses\nran away with my stepmother and little brother, and very nearly killed\nthem? While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching\nmarriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my\ngrandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had\ndone nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know\nyou had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy,\nand yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before\nso many people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but\nfor the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause\nof my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly\nand as steadily as I could.”\n\n30059m\n\n\n\n“Dear Valentine!”\n\n“Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of\nyour name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing,\nI was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by\nthe utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father\nstart, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must\nhave been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.”\n\n“‘Morrel, Morrel,’ cried my father, ‘stop a bit;’ then knitting his\nbrows into a deep frown, he added, ‘surely this cannot be one of the\nMorrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from\ntheir violent "

Night came, the two women had watched, hoping\nthat when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard\nhim pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his\nfootsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened\nthe door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an\nhour after Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went\nstealthily along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her\nhusband was doing.\n\nIn the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy\nherself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards Madame\nMorrel.\n\n“He is writing,” she said.\n\nThey had understood each other without speaking. Madame Morrel looked\nagain through the keyhole, Morrel was writing; but Madame Morrel\nremarked, what her daughter had not observed, that her husband was\nwriting on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he was writing his\nwill flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to\nutter a word.\n\nNext day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as\nusual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he\nplaced his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her\nfor a long time against his bosom. In the evening, Julie told her\nmother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that\nher father’s heart beat violently.\n\nThe next two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the\n4th of September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his\nstudy. Julie trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen.\nWhy did her father ask for this key which she always kept, and which\nwas only taken from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl\nlooked at Morrel.\n\n“What have I done wrong, father,” she said, “that you should take this\nkey from me?”\n\n“Nothing, my dear,” replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his\neyes at this simple question,—“nothing, only I want it.”\n\nJulie made a pretence to feel for the key. “I must have left it in my\nroom,” she said.\n\nAnd she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to\nconsult Emmanuel.\n\n“Do not give this key to your father,” said he, “and tomorrow morning,\nif possible, do not quit him for a moment.”\n\nShe questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he\nknew.\n\nDuring the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel\nremained listening for every sound, and, until three o’clock in the\nmorning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It\nwas three o’clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and\ndaughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since\nthe previous evening. At eight o’clock in the morning Morrel entered\ntheir chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible\nin his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he\nhad slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his\ndaughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and\nkissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel’s request, was\nfollowing her father when he quitted the room, but he said to her\nquickly:\n\n“Remain with your mother, dearest.” Julie wished to accompany him. “I\nwish you to do so,” said he.\n\nThis was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a\ntone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She\nremained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant\nafterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth\npressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.\n\n20053m\n\n\n\n“Maximilian, my dearest brother!” she cried.\n\nAt these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son’s\narms.\n\n“Mother,” said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and\nher daughter"

Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\nno.”\n\n“Then you are vexed with the engagement?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, listen,” said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and\nputting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “I am vexed, too, for I\ndo not love M. Franz d’Épinay.”\n\nAn expression of intense joy illumined the old man’s eyes.\n\n“When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you\nwere with me?” A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid. “Well,”\ncontinued Valentine, “the reason of my proposing it was that I might\nescape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.” Noirtier’s\nbreathing came thick and short.\n\n“Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you\ncould but help me—if we could both together defeat their plan! But you\nare unable to oppose them,—you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will\nis so firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am\nmyself. Alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me\nin the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my\njoys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.\nHowever, this is much, and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken\naway all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.”\n\nAt these words there appeared in Noirtier’s eye an expression of such\ndeep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words\nthere: “You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.”\n\n“Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine.\n\n“Yes.” Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him\nand Valentine when he wanted anything.\n\n“What is it you want, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine, and she\nendeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to\nneed; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated\nthem aloud, then,—finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a\nconstant _“No,”_—she said, “Come, since this plan does not answer, I\nwill have recourse to another.”\n\nShe then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When\nshe arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she\nhad spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.\n\n“Ah,” said Valentine, “the thing you desire begins with the letter N;\nit is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what can you\nwant that begins with N? Na—Ne—Ni—No——”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said the old man’s eye.\n\n“Ah, it is No, then?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before\nNoirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the old man’s eye was\nthoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down\nthe columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first\nfell into this sad state, Valentine’s powers of invention had been too\noften put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients\nfor gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so\nperfected her in the art that she guessed the old man’s meaning as\nquickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At\nthe word _Notary_, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.\n\n30169m\n\n\n\n“Notary,” said she, “do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?” The old man\nagain signified that it was a notary he desired.\n\n“You would wish a notary to be sent for then?” said Valentine.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Shall my father be informed of your wish?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa.

We traversed\nGreece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates. They were\nsurrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when\nsuddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was\nattracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the\nground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the\ngates, and beneath which were inscribed these words:\n\n‘_This is the head of Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina._’\n\n“I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she\nwas dead! I was taken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich\nArmenian. He caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I\nwas thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud.”\n\n“Of whom I bought her,” said Monte Cristo, “as I told you, Albert, with\nthe emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for\nthe purpose of holding my hashish pills.”\n\n“Oh, you are good, you are great, my lord!” said Haydée, kissing the\ncount’s hand, “and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master!”\n\nAlbert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard.\n\n“Come, finish your cup of coffee,” said Monte Cristo; “the history is\nended.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina\n\nIf Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated\ncountenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even\nshe would have been constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just\ngiven utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his\nstudy, where he received about two hours afterwards the following\nletter:\n\n“After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de\nVillefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed\nbetween his family and that of M. Franz d’Épinay. M. d’Épinay must say\nthat he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to\nbe aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not\nhave anticipated him in this announcement.”\n\n\nNo one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly\nunnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would\nhave supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance;\nalthough it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would\ncarry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.\nAnd in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier,\nwho never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always\nomitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life\nentertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Épinay,\nas he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to\nidentify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been\nconferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was\nkilled fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man\ngenerally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride\nof Villefort.\n\nHardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden\ndeparture of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much\nastonished everyone, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left\nalone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more\nembarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the\nroom; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his\nsudden disappearance.\n\nM. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited and\nconcise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place\nbetween M.

Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom\nfourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in\nProvidence?\n\n“And all this—all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was\nonly sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again,\nbecause I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast\nby a woman’s voice.\n\n“Yet,” continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the\nanticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Mercédès\nhad accepted, “yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman\nshould thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the\nprime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such\na point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which\nbecome crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some\npathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what\nwould be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.”\n\nThe blush of pride mounted to the count’s forehead as this thought\npassed through his mind.\n\n“Ridiculous?” repeated he; “and the ridicule will fall on me. I\nridiculous? No, I would rather die.”\n\nBy thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the\nnext day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercédès to\nspare her son, the count at last exclaimed:\n\n“Folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as\na mark for that young man to aim at. He will never believe that my\ndeath was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my\nmemory,—and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,—it is\nimportant the world should know that I have consented, by my free will,\nto stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which\nhas been so powerful against others I have struck myself. It must be;\nit shall be.”\n\nSeizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and\nwrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will,\nmade since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining\nthe nature of his death.\n\n“I do this, Oh, my God,” said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, “as\nmuch for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten years considered\nmyself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches, like Morcerf,\nDanglars, Villefort, even Morcerf himself, must not imagine that chance\nhas freed them from their enemy. Let them know, on the contrary, that\ntheir punishment, which had been decreed by Providence, is only delayed\nby my present determination, and although they escape it in this world,\nit awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for\neternity.”\n\nWhile he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking\ndreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and\nshone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his\njustification of Providence.\n\nIt was just five o’clock in the morning when a slight noise like a\nstifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his head, looked around him,\nand saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to\nconvince him of its reality.\n\nHe arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haydée,\nwho had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful\nhead thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his\ngoing out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot\nresist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching.\nThe noise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her\nwith affectionate regret.\n\n“She remembered that she had a son,” said he; “and I forgot I had a\ndaughter.” Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, “Poor Haydée,” said he;\n“she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed\nsomething.

The exclamations, the insults addressed to\nBenedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the energetic gestures,\nthe movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the scum of the crowd\nalways sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this\nlasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and magistrates were able\nto restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice of\nthe president was heard to exclaim:\n\n“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your\nfellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has\nnever been equalled?”\n\nSeveral persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over\nin his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and\nprotestations of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the\nhall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one\nanother. A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her\nwith a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of\ntumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,\nleaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most\ngraceful attitude possible, he said:\n\n“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of\nmaking a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable\nassembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I\nanswer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned\nme. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can\ntell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de\nVillefort, and I am ready to prove it.”\n\nThere was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the\nyoung man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment\ntowards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt\nhad changed him into a corpse.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;\n“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”\n\n“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,\ndeclared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”\n\n“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have\njust made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have\nbeen the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of\nthe 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.\nde Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I\nwas born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;\nmy father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me\nin a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,\nwhere he buried me alive.”\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\n\n“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the\npresident.\n\n“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\nme. "

Franz d’Épinay?”\n\n“Yes, madame.”\n\n“Is he not the son of General d’Épinay who was on our side, and who was\nassassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of\nElba?”\n\n“The same.”\n\n“Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a\nJacobin?”\n\n“Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,” said\nVillefort; “M. d’Épinay was quite a child when his father died, he\nknows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with\npleasure, at least with indifference.”\n\n“Is it a suitable match?”\n\n“In every respect.”\n\n“And the young man?”\n\n“Is regarded with universal esteem.”\n\n“You approve of him?”\n\n“He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.”\n\nDuring the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent.\n\n“Well, sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, after a few minutes’\nreflection, “I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to\nlive.”\n\n“You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de Villefort and\nValentine at the same time.\n\n“I know what I am saying,” continued the marchioness; “I must hurry\nyou, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother\nto bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my\npoor Renée, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.”\n\n“Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was obliged to give a\nmother to my child.”\n\n“A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the\npurpose,—our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in\npeace.”\n\nAll this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was\nsomething in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of\ndelirium.\n\n“It shall be as you wish, madame,” said Villefort; “more especially\nsince your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d’Épinay\narrives in Paris——”\n\n30319m\n\n\n\n“My dear grandmother,” interrupted Valentine, “consider decorum—the\nrecent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?”\n\n“My child,” exclaimed the old lady sharply, “let us hear none of the\nconventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the\nfuture. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly\nI have not been less happy on that account.”\n\n“Still that idea of death, madame,” said Villefort.\n\n“Still?—Always! I tell you I am going to die—do you understand? Well,\nbefore dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make\nmy child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey\nme;—in fact, I will know him—I will!” continued the old lady, with a\nfearful expression, “that I may rise from the depths of my grave to\nfind him, if he should not fulfil his duty!”\n\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “you must lay aside these exalted ideas,\nwhich almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in\ntheir graves, rise no more.”\n\n“And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a\nfearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over\nmy body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and\nwhat will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes\nshut, in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner\nwhere there is a door leading into Madame Villefort’s dressing-room—I\nsaw, I tell you, silently enter, a white figure.”\n\nValentine screamed.\n\n“It was the fever that disturbed you, madame,” said Villefort.\n\n30321m\n\n\n\n“Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white\nfigure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one\nof my senses, I heard my glass removed—"

You must not weep, no, you must not\ngroan, you must tremble!”\n\n“What can you mean?” asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.\n\n“I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found\nneither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!”\n\n“Neither of them there?” repeated Madame Danglars, her staring,\nwide-open eyes expressing her alarm. “Neither of them there!” she again\nsaid, as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the\nwords which escaped her.\n\n“No,” said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, “no, a hundred\ntimes no!”\n\n“Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive\nme? Where did you place it? tell me—where?”\n\n“There! But listen to me—listen—and you will pity me who has for twenty\nyears alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,\nwithout casting the least portion upon you.”\n\n“Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.”\n\n“You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed\nin the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,\nawaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me—motionless,\nbreathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.”\n\nMadame Danglars moved rapidly, as though she would spring from her\nchair, but Villefort stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore\nher attention.\n\n“We thought it dead,” he repeated; “I placed it in the chest, which was\nto take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole,\nand then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth,\nwhen the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow\nrise, and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to\ncry out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I\nfell lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your\nsublime courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged\nmyself to the foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came\nto meet me. We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful\ncatastrophe. You had the fortitude to regain the house, assisted by\nyour nurse. A duel was the pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely\nexpected it, our secret remained in our own keeping alone. I was taken\nto Versailles; for three months I struggled with death; at last, as I\nseemed to cling to life, I was ordered to the South. Four men carried\nme from Paris to Châlons, walking six leagues a day; Madame de\nVillefort followed the litter in her carriage. At Châlons I was put\nupon the Saône, thence I passed on to the Rhône, whence I descended,\nmerely with the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again placed on my\nlitter, and continued my journey to Marseilles. My recovery lasted six\nmonths. I never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire for\nyou. When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de\nNargonne, had married M. Danglars.\n\n“What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness\nreturned to me? Always the same—always the child’s corpse, coming every\nnight in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave\nwith menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to\nParis; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had\njust been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I\ndisliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife’s father and mother\nshould pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for\ncancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given\n10,000—I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the\ntenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so\nmuch wanted, I galloped to Auteuil. No one had entered the house since\nI had left it.\n\n“It was five o’clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room,\nand waited for night. There all the thoughts which had disturbed me\nduring my year of constant agony came back with double force. The\nCorsican, who had declared the vendet"
