We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. \"Every Englishman is our\nenemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our\nfields; they have burned our villages.\"\n\n\"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so\nbecause I think so, and not because I am in your power.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of\nNouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner\nof the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life.\nI would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions'\nheads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua\nhas spoken.\"\n\nSo saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled\nwith rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation.\nThen, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\"\n\nPaganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\ntake leave.\n\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\neyes.\n\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her.\n\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\nand you are angry?”\n\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.\n\n“Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Madame de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated.\n\n“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\nNoirtier again closed his eyes.\n\n“And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\nme?” cried Valentine.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued:\n\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\nme?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.\n\n“Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\n\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\n\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\n\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\n\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\ntogether?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\nold man assented.\n\n“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\nno.”\n\n“Then you are vexed with the engageme"

And how did he treat you?”\n\n“With more of mildness than severity.”\n\n“Did you tell him your whole story?”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?”\n\n“He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought\nme into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.”\n\n“By your misfortune?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?”\n\n“He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”\n\n“And that?”\n\n“He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”\n\n“What? the accusation?”\n\n“No; the letter.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“I saw it done.”\n\n“That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater\nscoundrel than you have thought possible.”\n\n“Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder. Is the world filled\nwith tigers and crocodiles?”\n\n“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more\ndangerous than the others.”\n\n“Never mind; let us go on.”\n\n“With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”\n\n“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only\nproof existing against you.’”\n\n“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”\n\n“To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.”\n\n“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could\npossibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”\n\n“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me\npromise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring\nme he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he\ninsisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned\nin the address.”\n\n“Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name\nat the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a\nGirondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?”\n\n“De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantès\ngazed on him in utter astonishment.\n\n“What ails you?” said he at length.\n\n“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.\nPoor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed\ngreat sympathy and commiseration for you?”\n\n“He did.”\n\n“And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this\nNoirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This\nNoirtier was his father!”\n\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its\nyawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely\ntransfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected\nwords. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to\nprevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his\nfather!”\n\n“Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de\nVillefort.”\n\nAt this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and\ncleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that\nhad come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the\nletter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the\nmagistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce\npunishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried\nout, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried\nto the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I\nmust be alone, to think over all this.”\n\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the\nturnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and\ncontracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue.

On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with\nwhich they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived,\nthat he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the\ncourse clear for them.\n\n\"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy\nto believe him.\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the major.\n\n\"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\"\n\n\"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope\nthat I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\"\n\n\"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he\ncould not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule\nof the company.\n\n[Illustration: \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle\nagainst my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian\nexplorers?\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia.]\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Paganel to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, \"come and\nbe umpires, and Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia, with the names of its discoverers and the\ndates of their explorations, as fluently as though his sole calling in\nlife was to be professor of Australian history. Rapidly he mentioned\nthe first twenty who found or traversed the Austral shores; as rapidly\ndid the names of the second score flow from his lips; and after the\nprescribed fifty had been enumerated, he kept on as though his list\nwere inexhaustible.\n\n\"Enough, enough, Monsieur Paganel!\" said Lady Helena. \"You have shown\nthat there is nothing, great or small, about Australia, of which you\nare ignorant.\"\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" said the geographer, with a bow.\n\nThen, with a peculiar expression, he smiled as he said to the major,\n\"We will talk about the rifle at another time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE STORM ON THE INDIAN OCEAN.\n\n\nTwo days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean.\n\n[Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.]\n\nThis state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain. It is better to\nbe without wind than to have a contrary one.\"\n\n\"Your lordship is right,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"but I dread some\nsudden change in the weather. We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, captain?
