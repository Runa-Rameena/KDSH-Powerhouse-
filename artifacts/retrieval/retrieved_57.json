      "text": "Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come. The crew and passengers stood on\ndeck. More than one felt the heart strangely moved. Lady Helena and\nMary Grant could not repress their emotion.\n\n\"Must it then be so?\" inquired the young wife of her husband. \"Must\nthis unfortunate be abandoned?\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL!\"]\n\n\"He must, Helena,\" answered Glenarvan. \"It is his punishment.\"\n\nAt this moment the boat, commanded by Captain Mangles, started. Ayrton\nraised his hat and gave a grave salute. Glenarvan and the crew returned\nthis last farewell, as if to a man about to die, as he departed, in a\nprofound silence.\n\nOn reaching the shore, Ayrton leaped upon the sand, and the boat\nreturned. It was then four o'clock in the afternoon, and from the upper\ndeck the passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms,\nstanding motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel.\n\n\"Shall we start, my lord?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, John,\" replied Glenarvan, quickly, with more emotion than he\nwished to manifest.\n\n\"All right!\" cried the captain to the engineer.\n\nThe steam hissed, the screw beat the waves, and at eight o'clock the\nlast summits of Tabor Island disappeared in the shadows of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nPAGANEL'S LAST ENTANGLEMENT.\n\n\nEleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the\nAustralian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed\nsince her departure from this port, during which time the travelers\nhad made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel.\nTheir efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked\nsurvivors of the Britannia.\n\nThe Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts\nof Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The\nvoyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of\nhappy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board.\n\nA mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always\nkeep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over\nhis ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy.\nBut in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not\nunbutton his coat.\n\nAt last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles\ndescried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's\nChannel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At\neleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon\nthe travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their\ntenantry and friends.\n\nThus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and\nthat John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo,\nwhere the Rev. Mr. Morton, who nine months before had prayed for the\nrescue of the father, now blessed the union of the daughter with one\nof his deliverers. It was arranged that Robert should be a sailor,\nlike his father and brother-in-law, and that he should continue the\ncontemplated project of the former, under the munificent patronage of\nLord Glenarvan.\n\nBut was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity.\nHis eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities.

You are included in\nthe conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,\nliable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,\nwhat would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,\nwith nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable\ninheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She\nhas been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost\nentirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,\nand that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and\nI accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother,\nbecause we were brought up together, and still more because it would\ngive you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this\nfish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax\nI spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\n\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as\nwell as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of\nMarseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful\nhousekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\n\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad\nmanager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she\nloves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my\nfriendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will\npromise no more than I can bestow.”\n\n“I understand,” replied Fernand, “you can endure your own wretchedness\npatiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Mercédès, beloved by\nyou, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should\nbecome rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a\nplace as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.”\n\n“You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you\nremain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a\nfisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you\nmore.”\n\n“Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of the\ncostume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,\na striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.\nWould not that dress please you?”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what do you\nmean? I do not understand you?”\n\n“I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because\nyou are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you\nawait is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”\n\n“Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were good-hearted, and I was\nmistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the\nanger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of\nwhom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of\nthe inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died\nloving me and me only.” The young girl made a gesture of rage. “I\nunderstand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not\nlove you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end\nwould that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and\nsee that friendship changed"

      "text": "bout to pass his sentence of life\nor death. To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and\ncurious, that the interest they had felt for the count’s safety became\nnow quite a secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a\nseat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\nrefused to support him.\n\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim.\n\n“‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\n\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\nassembly with ominous silence.\n\n“Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\n\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made\non his highness’s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four\nhundred thousand francs.\n\n“‘Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year\n1247 of the Hegira.\n\n“‘Signed, El-Kobbir.’\n\n“‘That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear"

      "text": "hout taking a crown from his\npocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and\nMorrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept\naway from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible\navailing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he\nreturned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.\n\nYet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh\nword. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s\nhand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the\nsecond floor had sent for Cocles.\n\n“Then,” said the two women to Emmanuel, “we are indeed ruined.”\n\nIt was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should\nwrite to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as\nspeedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they\nrequired all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,\nMaximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence\nover his father.\n\nHe was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided\non his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had\nconsulted young Maximilian’s taste. He had at once declared for a\nmilitary life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly\nthrough the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the\n53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected\npromotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was\nnoted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on\na soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name\nof “the stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this\nepithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know\nwhat it meant.\n\nThis was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid\nto sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon\nhave to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for\nthe moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles,\nJulie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features\nbetraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he\npassed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with\nunusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and\nexclaimed:\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could\never have believed it!”\n\nA moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three\nheavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.\n\nMorrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the\nmoney. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills\nreceivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of\neverything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500\nfrancs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on\naccount.\n\nHowever, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.\nThis calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest\ndejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and\nused to take his coffee at the club of the Phocéens, and read the\n_Semaphore_; this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his\noffice.\n\nAs to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he\nwent into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare\nand exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women,\nbut his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with\nthe business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung\nover the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping\nthat when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard\nhim pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his\nfootsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened\nthe door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an\nhour after"
