Morrel, his departure left no\ntrace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors\nof the _Pharaon_, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they\nalso had disappeared.\n\nCaptain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.\nHe delayed presenting himself at Morrel’s, but the owner, hearing of\nhis arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon’s\nrecital, of the captain’s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to\nconsole him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain\nGaumard had not dared to apply for.\n\nAs he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.\nPenelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was\nnewly clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much\nembarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place,\npassed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his\ngreat eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel\nas usual gave him by a slight pressure in return. Morrel attributed\nPenelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident\nthe good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he\nwas, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his\nbashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express\nourselves, worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer. Perhaps he had come\nto tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment\nfrom his new master.\n\n“Worthy fellows!” said Morrel,  as he went away, “may your new master\nlove you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!”\n\n20049m\n\n\n\nAugust rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew\nhis credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at\nMarseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said\nthat the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that\nMorrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier\nCocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when\nthe 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared\nbehind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with\nthe usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual\nprecision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had\nfully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills\nwhich the shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and\nthen, with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure\nwas put off until the end of September.\n\nOn the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme\nanxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel\nhad thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under\ngreat obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing\nthat Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he\nhad laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment\nthat Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had\nunlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his\npocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and\nMorrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept\naway from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible\navailing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he\nreturned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.\n\nYet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh\nword. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanue"

Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,\nthrew them into an almost empty drawer, saying:\n\n“Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.”\n\nCocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,\nhimself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more\nthan a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M.\nMorrel had passed many an anxious hour.\n\nIn order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his\nresources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get\nbruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an\nextremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wife’s and\ndaughter’s jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means the end of\nthe month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted. Credit,\nowing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the\none hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month, and\nthe one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M.\nde Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the\n_Pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had\nweighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in\nharbor.\n\nBut this vessel which, like the _Pharaon_, came from Calcutta, had been\nin for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the\n_Pharaon_.\n\n20033m\n\n\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.\nde Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of\nRome, presented himself at M. Morrel’s.\n\nEmmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of\nevery new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor,\ncome in anxiety to question the head of the house. The young man,\nwishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned\nthe new-comer; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to\nM. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M. Morrel in person.\n\nEmmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared, and the young\nman bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel’s apartment. Cocles went\nfirst, and the stranger followed him. On the staircase they met a\nbeautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked with anxiety at the\nstranger.\n\n“M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?” said the\ncashier.\n\n“Yes; I think so, at least,” said the young girl hesitatingly. “Go and\nsee, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman.”\n\n“It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,” returned the\nEnglishman. “M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has\nonly to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &\nFrench of Rome, with whom your father does business.”\n\nThe young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger\nand Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office\nwhere Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,\nopened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,\nconducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which\nhe closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of\nThomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.\n\nThe Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning\nover the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of\nhis liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the\nledger, arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen\nhim seated, res"

Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration: Port Famine.]\n\nCape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn\nis only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed\nbetween Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile\nshores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets\nof this tortuous labyrinth.\n\nThe Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious\nwindings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks.\nWithout lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories\nestablished on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened.\nThe yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern\nshores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks\nof Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation\nIsland. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and\nJacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved\nlike Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled\nbefore the breezes of the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE COURSE DECIDED.\n\n\nEight days after doubling Cape Pilares the Duncan entered at full speed\nthe Bay of Talcahuana, a magnificent estuary, twelve miles long and\nnine broad. The weather was beautiful. Not a cloud is seen in the sky\nof this country from November to March, and the wind from the south\nblows continually along these coasts, which are protected by the chain\nof the Andes.\n\nCaptain Mangles, according to Lord Glenarvan's orders, had kept close\nto the shore of the continent, examining the numerous wrecks that lined\nit. A waif, a broken spar, a piece of wood fashioned by the hand of\nman, might guide the Duncan to the scene of the shipwreck. But nothing\nwas seen, and the yacht continued her course and anchored in the harbor\nof Talcahuana forty-two days after her departure from the waters of the\nClyde.\n\n[Sidenote: LEARNING SPANISH!]\n\nGlenarvan at once lowered the boat, and, followed by Paganel, landed\nat the foot of the palisade. The learned geographer, profiting by the\ncircumstance, would have made use of the language which he had studied\nso conscientiously; but, to his great astonishment, he could not make\nhimself understood by the natives.\n\n\"The accent is what I need,\" said he.\n\n\"Let us go to the Custom-house,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThere they were informed by means of several English words, accompanied\nby expressive gestures, that the British consul resided at Concepcion.\nIt was only an hour's journey. Glenarvan easily found two good horses,\nand, a short time after, Paganel and he entered the walls of this great\ncity, which was built by the enterprising genius of Valdivia, the\nvaliant companion of Pizarro.\n\nHow greatly it had declined from its ancient splendor! Often pillaged\nby the natives, burnt in 1819, desolate, ruined, its walls still\nblackened with the flames of devastation, eclipsed by Talcahuana, it\nnow scarcely numbered eight thousand souls. Under the feet of its\nidle inhabitants the streets had grown into prairies. There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J.

He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"
