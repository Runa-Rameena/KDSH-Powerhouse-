Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\n\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5.

Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundat"

A young man\ndoes not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”\n\n“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”\n\n“Any way, mother.”\n\n“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”\n\n“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100\nfrancs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the\nornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of\nsuperfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs\nwe require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”\n\n“But we owe something in this house?”\n\n“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is\nunderstood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see\nI am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to\nthis, mother?”\n\nAnd Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a\nremnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of\nthe mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little\ndoor,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.\n\n“What is this?” asked Mercédès.\n\n“A thousand francs.”\n\n“But whence have you obtained them?”\n\n“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And\nAlbert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at\nher. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the\nyoung man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,\nindeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”\n\n“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear\nwhich glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted\nmisfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy\nwhile I possess my son!”\n\n“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the\ndecision we have come to, mother?”\n\n“Have we come to any?”\n\n“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am\nto leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the\nname I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès\nsighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the\nSpahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain\nfeeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his\nself-a"

      "text": "e?” asked he.\n\n“You will soon know.”\n\n“But still——”\n\n“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in\ndiscipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question\nsubordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.\n\nThe most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they\nwere in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor\noutside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him\non some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt\nto handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the\ndeputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not\npronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend?\nHad not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only\nproof against him?\n\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\n\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the\nright, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the\nprisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it\nwas there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn\nMercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\n\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’\nchamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A\nloud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not\nutter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a\nmadman?\n\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on,\nbut the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of\nland hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out\nto sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their\noars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.\n\nIn spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantès turned to the\nnearest gendarme, and taking his hand,\n\n“Comrade,” said he, “I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to\ntell me where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal Frenchman,\nthought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I\npromise you on my honor I will submit to my fate.”\n\nThe gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for\nanswer a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him now,” and\nthe gendarme replied:\n\n“You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know\nwhere you are going?”\n\n“On my honor, I have no idea.”\n\n“Have you no idea whatever?”\n\n“None at all.”\n\n“That is impossible.”\n\n“I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.”\n\n“But my orders.”\n\n“Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten\nminutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if\nI intended.”\n\n“Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must\nknow.”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he saw rise\nwithin a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which\nstands the Château d’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than\nthree hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to\nDantès like a scaffold to a malefactor.\n\n“The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we going there for?”\n\nThe gendarme smiled.\n\n“I am not going there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it is only used\nfor political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any\nmagistrates or judges at the Château d’If?”\n\n“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,\nand good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you\nwill make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good\nnature.”\n\nDantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.\n\n“You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the Château d’If to be\nimprisoned there?”\n\n“It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.”\n\n“Without any inquiry, without any formality?”\n\n“All the formalit"
