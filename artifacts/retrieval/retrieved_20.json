Morrel, his departure left no\ntrace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors\nof the _Pharaon_, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they\nalso had disappeared.\n\nCaptain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.\nHe delayed presenting himself at Morrel’s, but the owner, hearing of\nhis arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon’s\nrecital, of the captain’s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to\nconsole him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain\nGaumard had not dared to apply for.\n\nAs he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.\nPenelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was\nnewly clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much\nembarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place,\npassed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his\ngreat eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel\nas usual gave him by a slight pressure in return. Morrel attributed\nPenelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident\nthe good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he\nwas, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his\nbashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express\nourselves, worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer. Perhaps he had come\nto tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment\nfrom his new master.\n\n“Worthy fellows!” said Morrel,  as he went away, “may your new master\nlove you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!”\n\n20049m\n\n\n\nAugust rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew\nhis credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at\nMarseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said\nthat the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that\nMorrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier\nCocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when\nthe 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared\nbehind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with\nthe usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual\nprecision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had\nfully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills\nwhich the shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and\nthen, with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure\nwas put off until the end of September.\n\nOn the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme\nanxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel\nhad thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under\ngreat obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing\nthat Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he\nhad laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment\nthat Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had\nunlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his\npocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and\nMorrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept\naway from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible\navailing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he\nreturned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.\n\nYet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh\nword. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanue"

      "text": "and it was time. The two ladies exerted themselves\nheroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged\nthemselves along, they no longer walked.\n\nThe next day they started at daybreak, and at eleven o'clock Delegete\ncame in sight, fifty miles from Twofold Bay. Here means of conveyance\nwere quickly obtained. Feeling himself so near the coast, hope returned\nto Glenarvan's heart; perhaps there had been some slight delay, and he\nwould arrive before the Duncan! In twenty-four hours he would reach the\nbay!\n\nAt noon, after a comforting repast, all the travelers took their seats\nin a mail-coach, and left Delegete at the full speed of five strong\nhorses. The postilions, stimulated by the promise of a large reward,\ndrove them along at a rapid rate, over a well-kept road. No time was\nlost in changing horses, and it seemed as if Glenarvan had inspired\nall with his own intense eagerness.\n\n[Illustration: The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their\nstrength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no\nlonger walked.]\n\nAll day and all night they traveled with the same swiftness, and at\nsunrise the next morning a low murmur announced the proximity of the\nIndian Ocean. It was necessary, however, to pass around the bay to gain\nthat part of the coast where Tom Austin was to meet the travelers.\n\nWhen the sea appeared, all eyes quickly surveyed the wide expanse. Was\nthe Duncan there, by a miracle of Providence, as she had been discerned\nbefore by some of them on the Argentine coast? Nothing was seen; sky\nand water mingled in an unbroken horizon; not a sail brightened the\nvast extent of ocean.\n\nOne hope still remained. Perhaps Tom Austin had thought it best to cast\nanchor in Twofold Bay, as the sea was rough and a vessel could not be\nmoored in safety near such shores.\n\n\"To Eden!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe mail-coach at once took the road to the right, which ran along the\nedge of the bay, and proceeded towards the little town of Eden, only\nfive miles distant. The postilions stopped not far from the light that\nguarded the entrance to the harbor. Several ships were anchored in the\nroadstead, but none displayed the flag of Malcolm Castle.\n\nGlenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Paganel alighted immediately, and\nhastened to the custom-house. Here they questioned the employees, and\nconsulted the latest arrivals. No vessel had entered the bay for a week.\n\n\"She may not have started!\" cried Glenarvan, who would not despair.\n\"Perhaps we have arrived before her!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles shook his head. He knew Tom Austin; his mate would\nnever have delayed so long to execute an order.\n\n\"I will know what this means,\" said Glenarvan. \"Certainty is better\nthan doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOPE.]\n\nFifteen minutes later a telegram was sent to the ship-brokers of\nMelbourne, and the travelers repaired to the Victoria Hotel. Not long\nafter an answer was delivered to Lord Glenarvan. It read as follows:\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\n            Eden, Twofold Bay.\n\n\"Duncan started on the 18th instant for some unknown destination.\"\n\nThe dispatch fell from Glenarvan's hands. There was no more doubt! The\nhonest Scotch yacht, in Ben Joyce's hands, had become a pirate-vessel!\n\nThus ended their search in Australia, begun under such favorable\nauspices. The traces of Captain Grant and his shipwrecked sailors\nseemed irrecoverably lost. This failure had cost the lives of an entire\ncrew. Lord Glenarvan was crushed by the blow, and this courageous\nsearcher, whom the leagued elements had failed to deter, was now\nbaffled by the malice of men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nA ROUGH CAPTAIN.\n\n\nIf ever the searchers for Captain Grant had reason to despair of seeing\nhim again, was it not when every hope forsook them at once? To what\npart of the world should they venture a new expedition? how explore\nunknown countries? The Duncan was no longer in their possession, and\nthey could not be immediately reconciled to their misfortune. The\nundertaking of these generous Scots had, therefore, fail"

Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\ntake leave.\n\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\neyes.\n\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her.\n\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\nand you are angry?”\n\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.\n\n“Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Madame de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated.\n\n“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\nNoirtier again closed his eyes.\n\n“And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\nme?” cried Valentine.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued:\n\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\nme?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.\n\n“Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\n\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\n\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\n\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\n\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\ntogether?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\nold man assented.\n\n“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\nno.”\n\n“Then you are vexed with the engageme"

      "text": "gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter\nand seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in\nfive minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an"
