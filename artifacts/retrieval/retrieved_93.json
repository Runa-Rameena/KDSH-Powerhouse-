Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely\ntime to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm;\nthen, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable\nterror, she awaited the event.\n\nSomeone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine\nsummoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which\nannounces tranquil sleep.\n\n“Valentine!” said a low voice.\n\nThe girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.\n\n“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.\n\nStill silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was\nstill, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of\nsome liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she\nventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw\na woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her\nglass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or\nmoved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and\nleaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine\nslept: it was Madame de Villefort.\n\nOn recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,\nwhich caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly\nstepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,\nshe silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of\nValentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;\nshe fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp\nknife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself\nto close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate\norgans of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost\nimpossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the\neyelid open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however,\nreassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular\nbreathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the\ncurtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the\nglass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had\nleft the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair\nround arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread\ndeath around her.\n\n50077m\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine\nduring the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.\n\nThe grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the\nstupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to\ninsensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door\nagain turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.\n\n“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”\n\n“Oh,” murmured the young girl.\n\n“Have you seen?”\n\n“Alas!”\n\n“Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.\n\n“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”\n\n“Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?”\n\n“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the\nhouse?—can I not escape?”\n\n“Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you\neverywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be\noffered to you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water\nyou drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.”\n\n“But did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had\nneutralized the poison?”\n\n“Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and\nthe quantity increased.” He took the glass and raised it to his lips.\n“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a\nsimple narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it\nhas been dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has\npoured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been\ndoomed!”\n\n“But,” exclaimed the young girl"

      "text": "antès\nnoticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had, as he neared the\nland, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise,\ncan throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.\n\nBut on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything\nproceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came\noff with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in\nacknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the\nsea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the\nmorning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune Amélie_ and on _terra\nfirma_. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of _La\nJeune Amélie_, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred\nTuscan livres, or about eighty francs.\n\nBut the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards\nSardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace\nwhat had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the\nfirst, _La Jeune Amélie_ was in luck. This new cargo was destined for\nthe coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of\nHavana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.\n\nThere they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the\nexcise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune\nAmélie_. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded;\nDantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left\nshoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at\nbeing wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what\neye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear\nsuffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded\nhad exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.”\n\nHe had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death,\nand, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill\nof human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.\nDantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the\nend he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in\nhis bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and\nrushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all\nthe kindness of a devoted comrade.\n\nThis world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither\nwas it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing\nto expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the\nprize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.\nFortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain\nherbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old\nSardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try\nJacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his\nprize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.\n\nAs a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first\nbestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of\naffection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that\nEdmond had a right to superiority of position—a superiority which\nEdmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness\nwhich Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.\n\nThen in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with\nsecurity over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the\nhelmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,\nwith a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor\nAbbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of\nthe coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught\nhim to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call\nheaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\n\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these\nthings to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows? You ma"

Did the sun shine in my eyes?” And she leaned\nagainst the window.\n\n“The sun is not shining,” said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier’s\nexpression than by Valentine’s indisposition. He ran towards her. The\nyoung girl smiled.\n\n“Cheer up,” said she to Noirtier. “Do not be alarmed, Maximilian; it is\nnothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I not hear a\ncarriage in the courtyard?” She opened Noirtier’s door, ran to a window\nin the passage, and returned hastily. “Yes,” said she, “it is Madame\nDanglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. Good-bye;—I\nmust run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell\ntill I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you\nnot to persuade them to stay.”\n\n40274m\n\n\n\nMorrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little\nstaircase which led both to Madame de Villefort’s apartments and to\nhers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take\nthe dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how\nto understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to\nthe work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to\nfind every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before\nthe thought of the old man was translated by these words,\n\n“Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine’s room.”\n\nMorrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois’s\nsituation, and in Noirtier’s name gave that order. The servant soon\nreturned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier\nmade a sign that he wished to speak.\n\n“Why are the glass and decanter empty?” asked he; “Valentine said she\nonly drank half the glassful.”\n\nThe translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.\n\n“I do not know,” said the servant, “but the housemaid is in\nMademoiselle Valentine’s room: perhaps she has emptied them.”\n\n“Ask her,” said Morrel, translating Noirtier’s thought this time by his\nlook. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately.\n“Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de\nVillefort’s,” said he; “and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank\nwhat remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had\nemptied that to make a pond for his ducks.”\n\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his\nall on one stroke. From that moment the old man’s eyes were fixed on\nthe door, and did not quit it.\n\nIt was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen;\nthey had been ushered into Madame de Villefort’s room, who had said she\nwould receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her\nroom, which was on a level with Valentine’s, and only separated from it\nby Edward’s. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of\nofficial stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly\npeople manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them with\nequal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities\nwere resumed.\n\n“My dear friend,” said the baroness, while the two young people were\nshaking hands, “I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to\nyou the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti.”\nDanglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker found that it\nanswered better than count.\n\n“Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,” replied Madame de\nVillefort. “Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare\nqualities.”\n\n40276m\n\n\n\n“Listen,” said the baroness, smiling; “speaking to you as a friend I\ncan say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has\nabout him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons\nrecognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he\ngives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keen"

Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n\n“Everything depends on you.”\n\n“Explain yourself, pray.”\n\n“Monsieur,” said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, “do\nyou recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the\nemperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who\nwas accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of\nElba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor. You\nthen served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor—it was your\nduty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him—it is\nequally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?”\n\n0161m\n\n\n\nVillefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. “What is his\nname?” said he. “Tell me his name.”\n\n“Edmond Dantès.”\n\nVillefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a\npistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but\nhe did not blanch.\n\n“Dantès,” repeated he, “Edmond Dantès.”\n\n“Yes, monsieur.” Villefort opened a large register, then went to a\ntable, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to\nMorrel,\n\n“Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?” said he, in the\nmost natural tone in the world.\n\nHad Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these\nmatters, he would have been surprised at the king’s procureur answering\nhim on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the\nprison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in\nhis expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s\ncondescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.\n\n“No,” said Morrel; “I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,\nthe last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I\ncame about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to\nplead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were\nvery severe with the Bonapartists in those days.”\n\n“Monsieur,” returned Villefort, “I was then a royalist, because I\nbelieved the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen\nof the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the\nlegitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”\n\n“That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you speak thus, and I\naugur well for Edmond from it.”\n\n“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;\n“I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I\nrecollect now; it was a very serious charge.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de\nJustice.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was\ncarried off.”\n\n“Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done with him?”\n\n“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the\nSainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take\ncommand of your vessel.”\n\n“Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not\nalready returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be\nto set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”\n\n“Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n\n“There has been no arrest.”\n\n“How?”"
