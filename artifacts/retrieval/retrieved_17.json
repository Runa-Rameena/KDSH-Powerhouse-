To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and\ncurious, that the interest they had felt for the count’s safety became\nnow quite a secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a\nseat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\nrefused to support him.\n\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim.\n\n“‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\n\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\nassembly with ominous silence.\n\n“Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\n\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made\non his highness’s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four\nhundred thousand francs.\n\n“‘Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year\n1247 of the Hegira.\n\n“‘Signed, El-Kobbir.’\n\n“‘That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear"

He felt convinced of his identity,\nbut he did not venture to address him.”\n\n“An Englishman,” said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention\nwith which Julie looked at him. “An Englishman you say?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Maximilian, “an Englishman, who represented himself as\nthe confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It\nwas this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de\nMorcerf’s, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That\nhappened, as I told you, in 1829. For God’s sake, tell me, did you know\nthis Englishman?”\n\n“But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have\nconstantly denied having rendered you this service?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who,\ngrateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself\nhad forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”\n\n“Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”\n\n“What was his name?” asked Monte Cristo.\n\n“He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at the\ncount, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”\n\n“Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.”\n\nThen, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:\n\n“Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height, perhaps a little\ntaller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his\ncoat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?”\n\n“Oh, do you then know him?” cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.\n\n“No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who\nwas constantly doing actions of this kind.”\n\n“Without revealing himself?”\n\n“He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of\ngratitude.”\n\n“Oh, Heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in what did he\nbelieve, then?”\n\n30047m\n\n\n\n“He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said Monte\nCristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice; “but,\nperhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.”\n\n“And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?” inquired Emmanuel.\n\n“Oh, if you do know him,” cried Julie, “can you tell us where he\nis—where we can find him? Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover\nhim, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”\n\nMonte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked\nhastily up and down the room.\n\n“In the name of Heaven,” said Maximilian, “if you know anything of him,\ntell us what it is.”\n\n“Alas,” cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, “if Lord\nWilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him\nagain. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on\nthe point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he\nwill never return.”\n\n“Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,” said Julie, much affected; and\nthe young lady’s eyes swam with tears.\n\n“Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two\nliquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had Lord Wilmore seen\nwhat I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you\nshed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out his hand to\nJulie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the\ncount.\n\n“But,” continued she, “Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must\nhave known someone, can we not——”\n\n“Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after\nall, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no\nsecrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.”\n\n“And he told you nothing?”\n\n“Not a word.”\n\n“Nothing that would lead you to suppose?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“And yet you spoke of him at once.”\n\n“Ah, in such a case one supposes——”\n\n“Sister, sister,” said Maximilian, coming to the count’s aid, “monsieur\nis quite right.

You are included in\nthe conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,\nliable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,\nwhat would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,\nwith nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable\ninheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She\nhas been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost\nentirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,\nand that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and\nI accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother,\nbecause we were brought up together, and still more because it would\ngive you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this\nfish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax\nI spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\n\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as\nwell as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of\nMarseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful\nhousekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\n\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad\nmanager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she\nloves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my\nfriendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will\npromise no more than I can bestow.”\n\n“I understand,” replied Fernand, “you can endure your own wretchedness\npatiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Mercédès, beloved by\nyou, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should\nbecome rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a\nplace as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.”\n\n“You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you\nremain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a\nfisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you\nmore.”\n\n“Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of the\ncostume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,\na striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.\nWould not that dress please you?”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what do you\nmean? I do not understand you?”\n\n“I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because\nyou are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you\nawait is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”\n\n“Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were good-hearted, and I was\nmistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the\nanger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of\nwhom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of\nthe inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died\nloving me and me only.” The young girl made a gesture of rage. “I\nunderstand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not\nlove you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end\nwould that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and\nsee that friendship changed"

      "text": ". Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I\nmake no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as\nif it were your own, and then judge for yourself.”\n\nThe young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime\nresignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he\ntook off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank.\n\n“Be it so, then, my father,” he said, extending his hand to Morrel,\n“die in peace, my father; I will live.”\n\nMorrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son, but\nMaximilian caught him in his arms, and those two noble hearts were\npressed against each other for a moment.\n\n“You know it is not my fault,” said Morrel.\n\n20057m\n\n\n\nMaximilian smiled. “I know, father, you are the most honorable man I\nhave ever known.”\n\n“Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your\nmother and sister.”\n\n“My father,” said the young man, bending his knee, “bless me!” Morrel\ntook the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and\nkissing his forehead several times said:\n\n“Oh, yes, yes, I bless you in my own name, and in the name of three\ngenerations of irreproachable men, who say through me, ‘The edifice\nwhich misfortune has destroyed, Providence may build up again.’ On\nseeing me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you.\nTo you, perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me.\nThen do your best to keep our name free from dishonor. Go to work,\nlabor, young man, struggle ardently and courageously; live, yourself,\nyour mother and sister, with the most rigid economy, so that from day\nto day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and\nfructify. Reflect how glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn,\nthat day of complete restoration, on which you will say in this very\noffice, ‘My father died because he could not do what I have this day\ndone; but he died calmly and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I\nshould do.’”\n\n“My father, my father!” cried the young man, “why should you not live?”\n\n“If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be\nconverted into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man\nwho has broken his word, failed in his engagements—in fact, only a\nbankrupt. If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse\nis that of an honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would\navoid my house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last\nhome. Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your\nhead and say, ‘I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first\ntime, he has been compelled to break his word.’”\n\nThe young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.\n\n“And now,” said Morrel, “leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your\nmother and sister away.”\n\n“Will you not see my sister once more?” asked Maximilian. A last but\nfinal hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this\ninterview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. “I\nsaw her this morning, and bade her adieu.”\n\n“Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?” inquired\nMaximilian in a faltering voice.\n\n“Yes; my son, and a sacred command.”\n\n“Say it, my father.”\n\n“The house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or,\nit may be, selfishness—it is not for me to read men’s hearts—has had\nany pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to\nreceive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,\nbut offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my\nson, and respect this man.”\n\n“Father, I will,” said Maximilian.\n\n“And now, once more, adieu,” said Morrel. “Go, leave me; I would be\nalone. You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom.”\n\nThe young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of\nwill and not the power of execution.\n\n“Hear me, Maximilian,” said his father. “Suppose I were a soldier like\nyou, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew"
