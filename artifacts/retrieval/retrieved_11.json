This time he was\nboth seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At\nthe same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.\n\nAn instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards\nhim. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,\nand swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his\nstrength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to\nhim. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was\nalmost breathless.\n\nHe shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of\nthem cried in Italian, “Courage!”\n\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength\nto surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface,\nstruggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a\nthird cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were\nagain tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky\nturned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He\nfelt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had\nfainted.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan.\nHis first care was to see what course they were taking. They were\nrapidly leaving the Château d’If behind. Dantès was so exhausted that\nthe exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.\n\nAs we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his\nlimbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who\nhad cried out “Courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while\nthe third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with\nthat egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped\nyesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.\n\nA few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction\nof his limbs restored their elasticity.\n\n“Who are you?” said the pilot in bad French.\n\n“I am,” replied Dantès, in bad Italian, “a Maltese sailor. We were\ncoming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook\nus at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.”\n\n“Where do you come from?”\n\n“From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our\ncaptain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and\nfearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a\npiece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my\nlife, and I thank you,” continued Dantès. “I was lost when one of your\nsailors caught hold of my hair.”\n\n“It was I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and it was\ntime, for you were sinking.”\n\n“Yes,” returned Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank you again.”\n\n“I almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you looked more like\na brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair\na foot long.”\n\nDantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the\ntime he was at the Château d’If.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my\nhair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but\ntoday the vow expires.”\n\n“Now what are we to do with you?” said the captain.\n\n“Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped;\nbut I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be\nsure to find employment.”\n\n“Do you know the Mediterranean?”\n\n“I have sailed over it since my childhood.”\n\n“You know the best harbors?”\n\n“There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage\nover my eyes.”\n\n“I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès,\n“if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?”\n\n“If he says true,” said the captain doubtingly. “But in his present\ncondition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it\nafterwards.”\n"

Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to\nremind his son of a forgotten oath.\n\n“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have\npatience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”\n\nNoirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with\nindifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his\ngreatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand\nacross his forehead, entered his study.\n\nThe night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but\nVillefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the\nmorning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by\nthe examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,\nand putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was\none of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet\ndelivered.\n\nThe next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a\nshort time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its\nflickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as\nthough they had been dipped in blood.\n\nHe opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and\nseemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief\non the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.\nThe damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his\nmemory.\n\n“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of\njustice must strike wherever there is guilt.”\n\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man.\n\n“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”\n\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\neveryone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\nwhich accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him\nthe papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.\n\n“What are you bringing me?” said he.\n\n“A cup of chocolate.”\n\n“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”\n\n“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the\nmurder case, and that you should take something to keep up your\nstrength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the\nsofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.\n\nThe valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a\ngloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,\nhe swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought\nthat he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for\ndeath to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.\nHe then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been\nterrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort\nfelt no effects.\n\nThe breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The\nvalet re-entered.\n\n“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven\no’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”\n\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”\n\n“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and w"

      "text": "hout taking a crown from his\npocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and\nMorrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept\naway from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible\navailing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he\nreturned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.\n\nYet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh\nword. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s\nhand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the\nsecond floor had sent for Cocles.\n\n“Then,” said the two women to Emmanuel, “we are indeed ruined.”\n\nIt was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should\nwrite to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as\nspeedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they\nrequired all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,\nMaximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence\nover his father.\n\nHe was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided\non his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had\nconsulted young Maximilian’s taste. He had at once declared for a\nmilitary life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly\nthrough the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the\n53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected\npromotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was\nnoted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on\na soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name\nof “the stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this\nepithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know\nwhat it meant.\n\nThis was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid\nto sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon\nhave to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for\nthe moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles,\nJulie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features\nbetraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he\npassed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with\nunusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and\nexclaimed:\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could\never have believed it!”\n\nA moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three\nheavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.\n\nMorrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the\nmoney. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills\nreceivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of\neverything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500\nfrancs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on\naccount.\n\nHowever, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.\nThis calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest\ndejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and\nused to take his coffee at the club of the Phocéens, and read the\n_Semaphore_; this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his\noffice.\n\nAs to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he\nwent into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare\nand exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women,\nbut his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with\nthe business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung\nover the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping\nthat when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard\nhim pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his\nfootsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened\nthe door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an\nhour after"

The silence of the night was only interrupted by the\noccasional howlings of wild animals.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock, after an uneasy slumber, the major awoke. His\nhalf-closed eyes were attracted by a dim light that flickered beneath\nthe great trees. One would have thought it was a whitish sheet\nglittering like the surface of a lake. MacNabb imagined, at first, that\nthe flames of a conflagration were spreading over the ground.\n\n[Sidenote: STRANGE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.]\n\nHe rose and walked towards the wood. His surprise was great when\nhe found himself in the presence of a purely natural phenomenon.\nBefore him extended an immense field of mushrooms, which emitted\nphosphorescent flashes.\n\nThe major, who was not selfish, was about to waken Paganel, that the\ngeographer might witness the spectacle with his own eyes, when an\nunexpected sight stopped him.\n\nThe phosphorescent light illumined the wood for the space of half a\nmile, and MacNabb thought he saw shadows rapidly moving along the edge\nof the clearing. Did his eyes deceive him? Was he the sport of an\nillusion?\n\nHe crouched down, and, after a long and attentive observation,\ndistinctly perceived several men, who seemed by their movements to be\nsearching the ground for something. What could these men want? He must\nknow, and, without an instant's hesitation or awakening his companions,\nhe crawled along on all-fours, carefully concealing himself in the tall\ngrass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nA STARTLING DISCOVERY.\n\n\n[Sidenote: INCREASING PERPLEXITIES.]\n\nIt was a terrible night. At two o'clock in the morning the rain began\nto fall in torrents, which continued to pour from the stormy clouds\ntill daylight. The tent was an insufficient shelter. Glenarvan and\nhis companions took refuge in the cart, where they passed the time\nin conversing upon various subjects. The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence. The fury of the tempest gave them considerable uneasiness,\nsince it might cause an inundation, by which the cart, fast in the\nmire, would be overwhelmed.\n\n[Illustration: He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive\nobservation, distinctly perceived several men.]\n\nMore than once Mulready, Ayrton, and Captain Mangles went to ascertain\nthe height of the rushing waters, and returned drenched from head to\nfoot.\n\nAt length day appeared. The rain ceased, but the rays of the sun failed\nto penetrate the thick veil of clouds. Large pools of muddy, yellowish\nwater covered the ground. A warm vapor issued from the water-soaked\nearth and saturated the atmosphere with a sickly moisture.\n\nGlenarvan, first of all, turned his attention to the cart. In his eyes,\nthis was their main support. It was imbedded fast in the midst of a\ndeep hollow of sticky clay. The fore wheels were almost entirely out of\nsight, and the hind ones were buried up to the hubs. It would be a very\ndifficult matter to pull out the heavy vehicle, and would undoubtedly\nrequire the united strength of men, oxen, and horses.\n\n\"We must make haste,\" said Captain Mangles. \"If this clay dries, the\nwork will be more difficult.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the two sailors, the captain, and Ayrton then entered the\nwood, where the animals had passed the night.\n\nIt was a tall forest of gloomy gum-trees. Nothing met the eye but dead\ntrunks, widely separated, which had been destitute of their bark for\ncenturies. Not a bird built its nest on these lofty skeletons; not a\nleaf trembled on the dry branches, that rattled together like a bundle\nof dry bones. Glenarvan, as he walked on, gazed at the leaden sky,\nagainst which the branches of the gum-trees were sharply defined. To\nAyrton's great astonishment, there was no trace of the horses and oxen\nin the place where he had left them. The fettered animals, however,\ncould not have gone far.\n\nThey searched for them in the wood, but failed to find them. Ayrton\nthen returned to t"
