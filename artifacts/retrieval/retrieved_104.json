A young man\ndoes not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”\n\n“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”\n\n“Any way, mother.”\n\n“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”\n\n“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100\nfrancs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the\nornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of\nsuperfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs\nwe require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”\n\n“But we owe something in this house?”\n\n“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is\nunderstood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see\nI am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to\nthis, mother?”\n\nAnd Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a\nremnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of\nthe mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little\ndoor,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.\n\n“What is this?” asked Mercédès.\n\n“A thousand francs.”\n\n“But whence have you obtained them?”\n\n“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And\nAlbert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at\nher. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the\nyoung man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,\nindeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”\n\n“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear\nwhich glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted\nmisfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy\nwhile I possess my son!”\n\n“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the\ndecision we have come to, mother?”\n\n“Have we come to any?”\n\n“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am\nto leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the\nname I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès\nsighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the\nSpahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain\nfeeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his\nself-a"

Yet these two noble and\nintelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and\nfilial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and\neconomizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell his mother\nwithout extorting a change of countenance:\n\n“Mother, we have no more money.”\n\n50141m\n\n\n\nMercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of\npoverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there\nis a wide difference.\n\nAmongst the Catalans, Mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still\nshe never really wanted any. So long as the nets were good, they caught\nfish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine\nfor new nets. And then, shut out from friendship, having but one\naffection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she\nthought of herself—of no one but herself. Upon the little she earned\nshe lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported, and\nnothing to live upon.\n\nWinter approached. Mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked\nroom—she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the\nhall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower—she whose\napartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her\nson. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.\nExcitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the\nthings of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt\nthemselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having\nexhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.\n\n“Mother,” exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the\nstairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to\nbuild my plans upon.”\n\n“Capital—nothing!” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile.\n\n“No, mother,—capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a\ndelightful life upon this 3,000 francs.”\n\n“Child!” sighed Mercédès.\n\n“Alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “I have unhappily spent too\nmuch of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs are\nenormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous\ncertainty for the future.”\n\n“You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these\n3,000 francs?” said Mercédès, coloring.\n\n“I think so,” answered Albert in a firm tone. “We will accept them the\nmore readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in\nthe garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan, at Marseilles.\nWith 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.”\n\n“With 200 francs?—are you sure, Albert?”\n\n“Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and\nsteamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place in\nthe _coupé_ to Châlons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for\nthirty-five francs.”\n\nAlbert then took a pen, and wrote:\n\n\n                                                         Frs. _Coupé_,\n                                                         thirty-five\n                                                         francs........\n                                                         ..............\n                                                         ........ 35.\n                                                         From Châlons\n                                                         to Lyons you\n                                                         will go on by\n                                                         the\n                                                         steamboat..\n                                                         6.

To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room\nwhich now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the\nsilence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.\n\n“Edward!” he stammered—“Edward!”\n\nThe child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered\nhis mother’s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The\ncorpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading\nto the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch\nover the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and\nmysterious irony. Through the open door was visible a portion of the\nboudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch. Villefort\nstepped forward two or three paces, and beheld his child lying—no doubt\nasleep—on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy; a\nray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness. He\nhad only to step over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in\nhis arms, and flee far, far away.\n\nVillefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto\ndeath, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,\nbut phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning\nbrazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called\nhim, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the\ncheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs;\nhe pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,—the child\nwas dead.\n\nA folded paper fell from Edward’s breast. Villefort, thunderstruck,\nfell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rolled on the\nfloor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper, and,\nrecognizing his wife’s writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its contents;\nit ran as follows:\n\n“You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son’s sake I\nbecame criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son.”\n\nVillefort could not believe his eyes,—he could not believe his reason;\nhe dragged himself towards the child’s body, and examined it as a\nlioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his\nbreast, and he cried,\n\n“Still the hand of God.”\n\nThe presence of the two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude\nshared only by two corpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage,\nby his strength of mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the\nTitans to scale the heavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose,\nhis head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp,\ndishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone\ndetermined to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he\ncould relate his misfortunes,—someone by whose side he might weep.\n\n50195m\n\n\n\nHe descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted, and\nentered Noirtier’s room. The old man appeared to be listening\nattentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the\nAbbé Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as usual. Villefort, perceiving\nthe abbé, passed his hand across his brow. The past came to him like\none of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others.\n\nHe recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at\nAuteuil, and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on\nthe day of Valentine’s death.\n\n“You here, sir!” he exclaimed; “do you, then, never appear but to act\nas an escort to death?”\n\nBusoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the\nmagistrate’s face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that\nthe revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was\nignorant.\n\n“I came to pray over the body of your daughter.”\n\n“And now why are you here?”\n\n“I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and\nthat from this moment I "

The exclamations, the insults addressed to\nBenedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the energetic gestures,\nthe movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the scum of the crowd\nalways sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this\nlasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and magistrates were able\nto restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice of\nthe president was heard to exclaim:\n\n“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your\nfellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has\nnever been equalled?”\n\nSeveral persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over\nin his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and\nprotestations of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the\nhall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one\nanother. A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her\nwith a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of\ntumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,\nleaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most\ngraceful attitude possible, he said:\n\n“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of\nmaking a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable\nassembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I\nanswer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned\nme. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can\ntell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de\nVillefort, and I am ready to prove it.”\n\nThere was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the\nyoung man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment\ntowards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt\nhad changed him into a corpse.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;\n“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”\n\n“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,\ndeclared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”\n\n“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have\njust made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have\nbeen the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of\nthe 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.\nde Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I\nwas born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;\nmy father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me\nin a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,\nwhere he buried me alive.”\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\n\n“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the\npresident.\n\n“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\nme. "
